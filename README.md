Deep Reinforcement Learning for task offloading in edge computing environments.

It includes:

- systemModel.py: including definition of the task, MEC server, ...

- Training.py: RL  training process.

- Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms: DQN (DQN.py), Dueling DQN(Dueling.o), Double DQN(Double.py).

- Simulation.py: main simulation file.

## Required packages
- SimPy and Tensorflow 2.X

## How the code works
- run the file Simulation.py.

- For changing the numbers of user equipment, change the global variable 'UN' in the file Simulation.py.

- For changing the DQN algorithms, change the import of package in the file Training.py.
